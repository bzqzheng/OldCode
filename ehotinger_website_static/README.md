You can use the automation script to take any content inside of `new-content.html` and turn it into a new post for the website.  The HTML defined within the html file will be automatically copied into the inner HTML of the various pages.

**Here's a sample command:**

```
automation.py -n United States of Pop 2013 by DJ Earworm -t Music Remix Pop -c Music
```

```
-n specifies the title of the post
-t specifies a list of tags you want for the post
-c specifies which category this post should fall under "All"
```

```
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
```
